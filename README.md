# Canon EF to P8079HP Night Vision Tube Adapter

Adapter to allow attaching Canon EF lenses to a P8079HP image intensifier.

Added compartment to allow inserting 18650 battery holder and switch holder.

Ability to insert nuts and bolts to tighten the night vision tube.

Uses code from:
* http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1029872/#files - for the EF mount.  I adapted this to add locking tabs.
* https://www.printables.com/model/772241-m3-nut-cutout-model-with-openscad-code/files - used for adding holders for nuts.
